# It Starts With Adobe Project
## Overview 
~ late 2025 / 2026 a reqest for a page with new blocks was made. The blocks in question are coming from 
[made to create](https://main--cc--adobecom.aem.page/made-to-create) a CC page. 

We've pulled the blocks in wholesale, including CC's supporting files and structures. 

## Files Added 
We've added the following files 
|-blocks
    |-animated-photo-banner
    |-animated-slot-text
    |-animated-text-reveal
    |-bento-grid
    |-unity

|-scripts
    |-action.js
    |-utils.js

## Tech Debt 
There is some technical debt occrued through the inclusion of the utils.js file, which mimics our 
own scripts/scripts.js file in terms of functionality. We will need to copy what we need to support these
files in order to reduce that tech debt at a later date.
